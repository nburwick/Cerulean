For centuries, tornadoes have raised concerns as one of the most violent and devastating natural disasters. With their immense power and high-speed winds, they cause extensive damage, amounting to millions or even billions of dollars, impacting buildings, infrastructure, and the environment. The comprehensive dataset provided by FEMA offers valuable insights into tornadoes in the United States, including occurrence counts, affected regions, fatalities, property loss, and average intensity.

Given the widespread destruction and frequency of tornado occurrences across the United States, the primary objective of this project is to uncover valuable insights, such as identifying the regions that have suffered the most from tornadoes between 1950 and 2022. This analysis will consider factors such as property loss, fatalities, areas most affected, and the magnitudes of tornadoes in order to gain a deeper understanding of their impact.
